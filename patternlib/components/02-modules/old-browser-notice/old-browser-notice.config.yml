label: Old Browser Notice
notes: "A notice banner for older browsers encouraging users to upgrade. Really only targets old IE right now. Message is set to `display: none` unless it's a child of an element with a class of `ie6`, `ie7`, `ie8`, `ie9`. Use IE conditional comments to add these classes to the `html` root element."
