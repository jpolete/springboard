# Fractal Web UI

The Fractal web UI provides a web-based interface to browse your components and their associated files, as well as read project documentation. The UI itself relies on [themes](/docs/web/themes.md) to both generate the visual interface and to provide specific functionality.

The web UI functionality itself is actually just a [Fractal plugin](/docs/plugins/overview.md), although it comes bundled with Fractal by default so you won't ever need to install it separately.

## Getting started with the web UI

The web UI can be accessed in two ways:

1. You can start a **local server** to run it *dynamically*, which will mean that any local changes to your components or documentation pages are immediately reflected in the UI. This is great for when you are *developing* your component library.
2. You can generate a **static build** of the web UI, which is great for when you are ready to upload it to a server to share with others.

> If you are using the [Fractal interactive CLI](/docs/commands/overview.md#the-fractal-interactive-cli-sparkles) then these commands can be run without the `fractal` prefix once you have dropped into interactive mode.

### Starting the local development server

You can use the command `start` from within your project directory to start the local web server. It will start and then give you a local URL (for example `http://localhost:3000`) that you can use to view the web UI. Fractal will automatically find an available port to run the server on and give you a URL once it has started.

You can provide the following (optional) command line options to override the default configuration:

* `-p, --port <port-number>` - the port number to use, for example `5000`.
* `-t, --theme <theme-name>` - a custom theme to use.
* `-s, --sync` - whether to use [BrowserSync](https://www.browsersync.io) to provide auto-refresh and syncing capabilities
* `-w, --watch` - whether to watch components and documentation pages for changes

> If you using the [Fractal interactive CLI](/docs/overview.md#the-fractal-interactive-cli-sparkles) then you don't need to use the watch command - Fractal will automatically be watching your filesystem for changes.

As an example, the command:

```shell
fractal start --watch --port 4000 --theme my-custom-theme
```

Would start the preview server at the URL `http://localhost:4000` using the custom theme `my-custom-theme` and then watch the filesystem for changes.

> Note that themes must be installed before they can be used. See the [themes documentation](/docs/web/themes.md) for more information on creating and using custom themes.

### Building a static version of the web UI

You can use the `build` command to build a static HTML/CSS/JS version of the web UI. The static version will be generated into the directory specified in your project configuration, or a directory called `build` if not specified.

You can provide the following optional  command line options to override the default configuration:

* `-t, --theme <theme-name>` - a custom theme to use.

```shell
fractal build --theme my-custom-theme
```

Would generate a static build using the custom theme `my-custom-theme`.

## Configuration options

You can override the default web UI configuration in your [project settings file](#web-ui-settings).

> Note: Themes may additionally offer additional configuration items in addition to the basic set of web UI config outlined below.

 The available options are:

### Static assets path

The path to the directory where your static assets live. Any assets within this directory will be made available to your components and preview layouts at a URL path relative to this directory.

```js
fractal.set('plugins.web.static.path', 'public');
```
### Theme

The theme you'd like to use for the web preview UI. Note that you must install the theme as a NPM dependency as well as specifying it's name here. See the [themes documentation](/docs/web/themes.md) for more information.

```js
fractal.set('plugins.web.theme', 'my-custom-theme');
```

### Build directory

The directory within which the static build should be generated.

```js
fractal.set('plugins.web.build.path', 'build');
```

### Build path root

If you want to deploy your exported static build to a subfolder as opposed to a top level domain/subdomain, you'll need to specify a root path prefix so that the generated paths resolve correctly.

For example, if you were going to deploy the build to `http://example.com/my-subfolder` you could set the build root path as follows:

```js
fractal.set('plugins.web.build.root', 'my-subfolder');
```
