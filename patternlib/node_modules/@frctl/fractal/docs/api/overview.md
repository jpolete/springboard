# Fractal API Documentation

If you are using Node for your site, app or build tools then you can use Fractal as a dependency to give you programmatic access to your component library.

The [integration guide](/docs/guides/integration.md) gives some examples of how to best integrate your component library with other projects. You can then use the Fractal API to access your components and data from within your application itself.
