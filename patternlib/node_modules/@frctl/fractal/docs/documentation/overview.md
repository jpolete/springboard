# Documentation Overview

Fractal makes it easy to create documentation for your project. Documentation pages are written in [Github-flavoured Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) and support the use of YAML 'front-matter' for configuration, as well as configuration via [standalone config files](/docs/configuration-files.md).

Additionally, if you need to generate more complex documentation, you can use a template language of your choosing (as for [components](/docs/components/overview.md), the default is [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com)) to help dynamically generate pages.

Pages can be organised into as many folders and sub-folders as is necessary for your project, but must all reside in the documentation folder that you have configured in your `fractal.js` [project settings file](/docs/project-settings.md#documentation-settingss).

## A simple page

A very simple documentation page might look like this:

```markdown
This is some documentation for the project. Still to do:

* Finish the docs
* Write tests
* Make the tea 
```
Fractal will then take that and turn it into HTML ready for display:

```html
<p>This is some documentation for the project. Still to do:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Finish the docs</li>
    <li>Write tests</li>
    <li>Make the tea</li>
</ul>
```
If there is no configuration data available (see below) then Fractal will generate metadata (such the title of the page) based on the file name.

## YAML front-matter

YAML 'front-matter' is a way of specifying configuration data at the top of a markdown file. It is a block of [YAML] that is fenced-off from the rest of the document via triple hyphen (`---`) separators. For example:

```yaml
---
title: Change Log
---
This is the body of the page
```

In this case we are specifying that we want the title of the page (used in the web UI and other places) to be 'Change Log'. To see a full list of available configuration items, check out the [documentation configuration reference](/docs/documentation/configuration.md).

If you don't want to use YAML front matter, you can also use a [separate configuration file](/docs/configuration-files.md) in the same way as you would for a component. 

## Using data in pages

Because pages are rendered using Handlebars (or another [template engine](/docs/engines.md) of your choosing) before being run through the Markdown processor, you can easily dynamically generate sections of pages.

As for components, any data that you wish to have access to in the page must be specified under the `context` property. You can then use Handlebars to generate content based on that data.

For instance, if you are using YAML front matter, you could re-create the example at the start of this page as follows:

```handlebars
---
title: Project Overview
context:
  items:
    - Finish the docs
    - Write tests
    - Make the tea
---
This is some documentation for the project. Still to do:

{{#each items}}
* {{ this }}
{{/each}}
```
> It's important to note that the template engine rendering happens **before** the Markdown parsing, so you are free to use it to generate Markdown or HTML (which is ignored by Markdown parsers). 

### Accessing page metadata
 
Pages only have direct access to data specified within the `context` object. If you need to access information about the page itself (such as the `title`) you have to use the special `_self` variable, as follows:

```handlebars
{{ _self.title }} <!-- Outputs: Project Overview -->
```
This is to prevent page configuration data clashing with context data intended to be used when rendering the page.

Note that the `_self` variable is actually a JSON representation of the page object itself, and not just a regurgitation of configuration data (i.e. `title` will have a value whether or not it is overridden in the configuration, as Fractal generates one for every page).

## Ordering pages

Pages can be ordered by prefixing file names with a **two digit number** (with leading zero, if required) **followed by a hyphen**. For example:

```
├── pages
│   ├── 01-index.md
│   ├── 02-changelog.md
│   └── 03-naming-conventions.md
```

Order prefixes are ignored when auto-generating page titles.

Alternatively, you can use the `order` property in the [page's configuration settings](/docs/documentation/configuration.md) to specify an order without amending the filename.

## Hiding pages

Pages can be hidden from listings and navigation in two ways. You can either specify `hidden: true` in the pages's [configuration file](/docs/documentation/configuration.md) or you can prefix the page's filename with an underscore. So in the following example, the `changelog` page would not show up in any navigation:

```
├── pages
│   ├── _changelog.md
│   ├── index.md
│   └── naming-conventions.md
```

> You can also combine *ordering* and *hiding* by constructing a filename such as `_01-changelog.md`.
