<p>I entered the wood by its sourthern corner. Debris was beginning to drop from the moving canopy: twigs and beechnuts, pattering down onto the coppery layer of leaves. Sunlight fell in bright sprees on the floor. I walked up through the wood, and midway along its northern edge I came to my tree – a tall grey-bark beech, whose branches flare out is such a way that it is easy to climb.</p>

<p>I had climbed the tree many times before, and its marks were all familiar to me. Around the base of its trunk, its grey bark has sagged and wrinkled, so that it resembles the skin on an elephant’s leg. At about ten feet, there is a branch that crooks sharply back on itself; above that, the letter ‘H’, scored with a knife into the trunk years before, which has ballooned with the growth of the tree; higher still is the healed stump of a missing bough.</p>
