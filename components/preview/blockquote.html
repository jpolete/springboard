  <p>From The Haunting of Hill Houseâ€¦</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    No live organism can continue for long to exist sanely under conditions
    of absolute reality; even larks and katydids are supposed, by some, to 
    dream. Hill House, not sane, stood by itself against its hills, holding 
    darkness within; it had stood so for eighty years and might stand for 
    eighty more. Within, walls continued upright, bricks met neatly, floors 
    were firm, and doors were sensibly shut; silence lay steadily against 
    the wood and stone of Hill House, and whatever walked there, walked 
    alone.
