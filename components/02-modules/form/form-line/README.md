Form lines group form inputs together on a single line on larger viewports. Use child `div`s to wrap labels, inputs and other input-related elements. 

Child `div`s can include a `portion-1`, `portion-2`, or `portion-3` class to indicate the fraction of the line that the child should take up. No class is the same as `portion-1`.
