title: Springboard
---

Springboard is an HTML, CSS (SASS), and JavaScript starter kit for new projects. Base styles are provided for most common HTML elements. Additionally some common UI elements are defined as "modules"â€”things like button styles, a flexible grid, common social media icons, form element layouts, notice boxes, etc.

## Technology

This pattern library was built using the excellent [Fractal](https://github.com/frctl/fractal) by [Mark Perkins](http://github.com/allmarkedup) at [Clearleft](http://clearleft.com/) .

To add or edit patterns, modify components in the `componentlib/components` folder. Edit CSS/SASS in the `componentlib/sass` folder. The full documentation for Fractal can be found [here](http://fractal.build/).

## Usability & Accessibility

Much of the usability and accessibility ideas were taken from Heydon Pickering's excellent book [Inclusive Components](https://inclusive-components.design/).
