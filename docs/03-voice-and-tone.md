  <ol>
    <li>Get out your own head and get to know the user.</li>
    <li>The user is a person. Talk to them like one.</li>
    <li>Use copy as a guide, not a crutch.</li>
    <li>Treat every moment like a branding moment, even when itâ€™s not.</li>
    <li>If content is king, then treat context like a queen.</li>
  </ol>
